# Getting Data

These are some notebooks demonstrating various ways to download data using Python packages. These examples are intended to be run using an ArcGIS Desktop install of Python.



Prior to running these notebooks, various Python packages need to be installed. The `ArcGISPostInstall.bat` batch file located in the Installation folder should take care of installing all necessary packages. 



These examples include the following hands on demonstrations:

* Accessing web-hosted csv and txt files directly using `pandas`
* Fetching files on a web server with `urllib`
* Fetching files on an ftp server with `ftplib`
* Grabbing HTML tables with `pandas`
* Scraping data with `requests` and `bs4`
* Using specialized Python packages for data download `Census`




The objectives of this lesson are twofold:

* First, it will reveal some actual strategies for automating data download for your course projects or for other tasks. 
* Second, it introduces concepts relating to "web-GIS" and "cloud computing" that we will follow up in subsequent lectures...
